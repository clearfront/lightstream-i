        <h2>George Wrights</h2>
        <p class="largeText"> George Wright Brewing Company is a small independent craft brewery based in Rainford, Merseyside. </p>
        <p class="largeText"> The brewery asked us to create an ecommerce store that would be used to create personalised beer bottle labels that when purchased would be printed and attached to the brewing company’s own brands of beer. </p>
        <p class="largeText"> Using the application a customer can edit messages and upload personal photos to create beer labels that are personal and fun. </p>

        <h2>The Concept</h2>
        <p class="largeText">The brief was to create a label designing application that allowed users to create their own labels using their images and an array of chosen designs then apply them to beer gift packs that can be ordered through the site. </p>
        <p class="largeText"> Despite using quite a complex integration of advanced web technologies the brief was to also make this application quick and easy for the customer to use. </p>

      <p class="largeText">As the requirement for the application was quite unique and bespoke to the client’s needs the best way to approach the project was from the ground up. This allowed us to really concentrate on exactly where we should lay out the elements pages to ensure a clean user experience. </p>
