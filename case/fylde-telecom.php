       <h2>The Concept</h2>
      <p class="largeText">Fylde Telecom’s main goal was to allow online repair tracking on any device using a clear and straight forward interface. The admin area needed to be straight forward to use and quick to load. </p>
      <p class="largeText"> As the requirement for the application was quite unique and bespoke to the client’s needs the best way to approach the project was from the ground up. This allowed us to really concentrate on exactly where we should lay out the elements pages to ensure a clean user experience. </p>

      <h3>Responsive</h3>
      <p class="largeText">Fylde Telecom knew that being a mobile phone repair company many customers would be accessing their website from mobile devices rather than a laptop or PC. We therefore created a tailored responsive website which would look good and work efficiently on all devices.</p>
