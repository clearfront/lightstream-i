    <h1>Responsive, Mobile and Traditional Web Design</h1>
      <p>Web Design is not all about great animation and 
        flashing banners – it’s also about functionality, usability and 
        appropriate styling. A good Web Design or Application is important to a 
        companies success.</p>
      <p>We produce bespoke web design and we build our clients sites from 
        the ground up, from the initial code to the final graphical animation. 
        With this method of development we have produced exceptional and 
        effective applications time and time again.</p>
          <h2>Responsive Web Design</h2>
      <h3>How do you like to browse the web?</h3>
      <p>Increasingly more and more people are choosing alternative methods to browse the web and websites need to look and function the same no matter where you view it. This is where responsive web design comes in</p>
      <p>The Internet in now accessible from a vast range of devices from desktop computers to smart phones and tablets. The the challenge is to produce visually appealing designs whilst making the site usable on all screen sizes. </p>
      <p>But there is a solution. Responsive Web design.</p>
      <h3>Adaptive Website Design for Multiple Devices</h3>
      <p>Most traditional methods  of web design involved only producing a website that would only cater for larger screen resolutions such as desktop computers. This made using the website difficult on smaller screen sizes such as tablets and mobile phones. Users had to adapt to pinching in and out on the devices to get the content. This resulted in a poor user experience. </p>
      <p>Because the websites were designed to work with a mouse and keyboard </p>
      <p>Until recently companies had to build bespoke versions of the website for each device category. A version for mobile, desktop and tablet. This would require large amounts of extra resource to build a usable version for each device. This often resulted with inconsistent versions that took more time to maintain. </p>
