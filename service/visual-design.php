      <p class="largeText">Visual design is the broad term used to describe how a website looks. The visual design is a carefully considered combination of colour, composition, hierarchy, texture, shape and typography. Visual design is a lot more than mere decoration it informs the user experience and commutates the correct purpose of the website and how the user should go about using it.
