</h2>
      <p class="largeText"><strong>Visual design refers the look and feel of a website or application.
</strong>
</p>
      <p class="largeText">Visual design provides aesthetic appeal, emotional response and that all important first impression. It makes the underlying user experience design properly work by juggling many different elements such as colour, hierarchy, texture, shape, typography and composition. Visual design is more than mere decoration; it makes the design speak with a visual language of its own. Our visual designs are always provided in the form of a componentised style guide and pattern portfolio â€“ this means we provide a design system which can work into the future, rather than a series of single page designs.
