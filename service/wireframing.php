</h2>
      <p class="largeText"><strong>Wireframes are the blueprints of web design and application design.

      <p class="largeText">Wireframes are low-detail representations of an interface. They tend to omit colour, imagery and other visual design specifics, providing a simple inventory of the contents and layout of a page instead. For the sake of speed, we almost always sketch wireframes with pen and paper. Sometimes a sketch is enough to convey the detail required; sometimes we add fidelity by creating an interactive prototype from the sketched wireframes.
