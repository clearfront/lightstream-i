      <p class="largeText"><strong>Responsive Web Design is about designing and developing a website to adapt to a multitude viewing environments.
</strong>
</p>
      <p class="largeText">Typically a responsively designed website will look different when viewed on a mobile phone, tablet, or a widescreen monitor (and all sizes in between). The layout and content such as images will be automatically optimised according to the device on which it is being viewed. Responsive design requires close collaboration between visual designer and front-end developer.
