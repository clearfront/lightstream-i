        <h2>Interactive Prototyping</h2>
      <p class="largeText"><strong>Interactive prototypes are working models of websites or applications, built for testing before further design and development work is undertaken.</strong>
</p>
      <p class="largeText">Our interactive prototypes are built using HTML & CSS and run in a web browser to give the best sense of how the web site will feel. We use interactive prototypes in usability testing to help us validate and refine design decisions at an early stage in the process. By annotating our prototypes, we create interactive wireframes which explain and document page structures and behaviours in situ, enabling our development partners to use the prototype as a specification for the back-end build. Seeing and feeling a living design is a far more efficient and effective method than writing long abstract functional specifications.
