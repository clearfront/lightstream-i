      <p class="largeText"><strong>User Experience Design (UXD) is a broad term we use to encompass designing how a person uses a website or application.
</strong>
</p>
      <p class="largeText">User Experience Design includes defining a person’s journeys through the site; how he or she uses the site’s functions and how the pages are structured to help a person achieve their goals. Good UXD is all about user-centred design, that is to say putting people first.
